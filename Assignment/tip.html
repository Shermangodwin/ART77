    As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully
    vaccinated might be feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still

 “'Fully vaccinated' means that you completed a COVID-19
    vaccine series as recommended for the best protection against
    severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No
    vaccine offers 100% protection against illness, yet it does give
    you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of
    being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.” <br><br>

    <span style="color: yellow; font-size: 50px;"> Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to
        others, including other vaccinated people? </span><br><br>

        While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower
        rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune
        response to vaccines. <br>
        “The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health
        disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines.
        We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these
        vulnerable populations.”<br>
